It is a product of Kevin Rathbun Steak, which has several locations around Atlanta. The sandwich is comprised of a generous portion of New York strip steak on a brioche bun, with au jus to flavor and horseradish sauce on the side. It comes with kettle chips for $15. The ""Big Kev"" is a double portion for $28, and may well be enough to satisfy two people. While the pressbox fare is always an option for we media types, if I'm going to spend money, then there's a good chance it's going to be for a Rathbun's steak sandwich.  — Grant McAuley /// On the 200 level concourse behind home plate and a little bit up the 1B line is a newer stand for famed Atlanta Chef Kevin Rathbun.

Was a wildly popular Chicago staple until it closed amid much fanfare in 2013 or ’14. — Phil Rogers /// It's really not close. The best food at Wrigley is the Hot Doug's sausage stand in the bleachers. It's basically behind the center-field part of the stands on the rebuilt concourse back there. If you're not familiar, Hot Doug's was a hot dog place that sold fancy encased meats with some nice toppings. There would regularly be a line to get in and on Friday's they'd have a really long line because that's when they had their duck fat fries. At some point in 2014, I believe, they announced they were closing. So the lines became a daily thing, and as it got closer to the closing date, the lines got longer and longer, with people waiting up to eight hours to get their hands on these encased meats. Now it's closed, but the owner does random pop-up events and last summer (2015) he struck a deal with the Cubs and now there's a stand that changes it's offering every so often. It's really quality stuff.
