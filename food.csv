The ""Big Kev"" is a double portion for $28, and may well be enough to satisfy two people. While the pressbox fare is always an option for we media types, if I'm going to spend money, then there's a good chance it's going to be for a Rathbun's steak sandwich.  — Grant McAuley /// On the 200 level concourse behind home plate and a little bit up the 1B line is a newer stand for famed Atlanta Chef Kevin Rathbun.

The best food at Wrigley is the Hot Doug's sausage stand in the bleachers. It's basically behind the center-field part of the stands on the rebuilt concourse back there. If you're not familiar, Hot Doug's was a hot dog place that sold fancy encased meats with some nice toppings. There would regularly be a line to get in and on Friday's they'd have a really long line because that's when they had their duck fat fries. At some point in 2014, I believe, they announced they were closing. So the lines became a daily thing, and as it got closer to the closing date, the lines got longer and longer, with people waiting up to eight hours to get their hands on these encased meats. Now it's closed, but the owner does random pop-up events and last summer (2015) he struck a deal with the Cubs and now there's a stand that changes it's offering every so often.

Because of that, the chefs at PNC Park have started to incorporate these flavors into some of the menu items. Sure, you can get nachos or a pretzel, but don’t you want to try something like the pulled pork pierogi stacker, found at Manny’s BBQ behind centerfield? As a bonus, during most games Manny Sanguillen is there signing autographs too. — Ethan Obstarcyzk /// For my money, the best buy at PNC Park is the house-smoked Pulled Pork Pierogi Stacker. Though Pittsburgh is far too well-known for its Primanti Bros. sandwiches — french fries and thinly sliced deli meat piled high on huge slabs of white bread — what could be more Pittsburgh than house-smoked pulled pork, caramelized onions, and a couple pierogis stacked inside a salty pretzel bun slathered with onion glaze? It’s been a fan favorite for years now. Stop by Manny’s BBQ in center field to give the pulled pork and pierogi stacker a try. The BBQ stand is named after Manny Sanguillen, a former Pirates catcher and three-time All-Star who is a familiar, smiling, everyday staple at Pirates home games. — Stephen Nesbitt /// As you get down the 1B/RF concourse at PNC Park (as in, moving from home plate to the right field corner), there's a stretch of local food places that's usually where I find myself eating: Primanti Brothers, Quaker Steak and Lube, and I believe BRGR are all there.

My first recommendation on this note would be Gaucho, located at the end of Pittsburgh's Strip District.

Most of the sandwiches come with well paired toppings, like grilled onions and peppers, arugula and tomato, and so forth. But I have not yet even gotten to describe the sauces. An aja, chimchurri, and roja sauce are available plentifully from large jars in the restaurant and they are, quite simply, some of the best sauces you'll ever have. Gaucho also has some of the most beautiful salads I've ever seen, and you can add meats for a small upcharge.

The burgers are high quality and reasonably priced. Then again, most places in Milwaukee are reasonably priced when compared to bigger cities. Regardless, the options, quality, and prices combine to give Oscar's the win. Note: This is not the ""Oscar's Frozen Custard"" chain of stores. — Adam (Brewer Nation)

There are several bars that cater to the pre and post-game crowds and serve mainly bar-type sandwiches and fare.  A newer addition on Bluemound is Story Hill BKC, which has more upscale options with a tapas-style menu as well as bigger entrees.  It’s a smaller place, so may be crowded on game days. — Sean Roberts",

They made their name on burgers and as visiting scribes will tell you, it's a place worth hitting up when you're in town. It sits just two and a half miles from Miller Park and, while very popular and often busy, is great food and a good atmosphere. — Adam (Brewer Nation) /// Milwaukee loves its burgers, and other local favorites include Sobleman’s, with 3 locations and famous for their bloody mary’s such as the “baconado” and a bloody garnished with a whole fried chicken.  - Sean Roberts",

There is a casino just down the road though! Go out of your way to get some Oakland Gyros though. Best gyros in Milwaukee. You don't want 4-Star food anyway, right? - Dereqk Harvey",

Cubanita’s is a smaller place and is Milwaukee’s only Cuban restaurant.  Classics like yucca, fried plantains, and seafood are all well done, but their Cuban sandwich (with bread flown in from the east) is excellent and a cheap option.

PHI,Jake's Wayback Burger,"1 Citizens Bank Way, Philadelphia, PA 19148",,39.905993,-75.16664,PARK,"There are two other notable places outside of Ashburn Alley that deserve consideration. The first is Jake's Wayback Burger, located just to the third base side of the left field foul pole. They introduced a triple-triple burger last year, which is really just nine beef patties and nine slices of cheese in alternating succession between two buns. It contains 2200 calories. Despite sounding terrible, I thought it was actually pretty good. Unlike generic stadium burgers, these were not overcooked. I tried it during the Phillies on-deck series last spring and wrote about it at The Good Phight (http://www.thegoodphight.com/2015/4/4/8345825/citizens-bank-park-concession-review-the-nonuple-burger) - Eric Chesterton",
PHI,Schmitter,"1 Citizens Bank Way, Philadelphia, PA 19148",,39.905993,-75.16664,PARK,"Second, is the Schmitter, which is basically a cheesesteak with even more unhealthy and, therefore, delicious stuff such as salami, fried onions, tomatoes, a thousand islandy secret sauce. It is located across from Jake's Wayback Burgers in left field behind section 140. — Eric Chesterton /// Now in terms of ""best,"" the once and future king of Phillies food is The Schmitter, a monstrosity of meat, cheese, and onion rings. It's in Section 141, and if you're not a monster like me and enjoy cheese, then you pretty much have to do it once.  - Trevor Strunk",
PHI,Federal Donuts,"1 Citizens Bank Way, Philadelphia, PA 19148",,39.905993,-75.16664,PARK,"Also, there's a Federal Donuts in the park. Another great choice. — Jared Diamond /// In terms of the one I'm speculating on -- Federal Donuts has a donut and fried chicken place in section 140. I haven't had FedDonut yet, but it's by all accounts sublime, and there's nothing I'd rather fill my heart valves with at a Phillies game than a gourmet donut and fried chicken. — Trevor Strunk",
PHI,Chickie and Pete's,"1 Citizens Bank Way, Philadelphia, PA 19148",,39.905993,-75.16664,PARK,"So three answers, because I'm weird and I don't like cheese (I know I know) and because one of these picks is speculative since it's come in since I've moved to Chicago. First, the thing I think is most worth getting -- most perfectly Philadelphia -- is the Chickie and Pete's Crab Fries (Ashbury Alley/Section 102). They're greasy, salty, and a whole portion gives me a headache, but there's a reason they have a line: they're tremendous. Also the dollar Hatfield hot dogs are not to be missed, though that's a promotional, not every-night thing. - Trevor Strunk",

That said, some quick research reveals that there is a classic Philly area diner called the Penrose Diner about an 18 minute walk from the stadium. I have never set foot there, but listen: there are few things as wonderful as a Philadelphia area diner in my mind, and Penrose looks like a classic.

If you're tolerant of bad service, The Royal Tavern at 7th and Passyunk offers, for my money, the best burger in town and a solid selection of mostly local beers. - Eric Chesterton ",

PHI,New Harmony Vegetarian Restaurant,"135 N 9th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107",,39.954466,-75.154307,7,"But I think the most interesting and impressive food I've had in Philly is in Chinatown -- this place called New Harmony Vegetarian Restaurant on 9th and Cherry Streets. The food is unbelievable, and, as a meat eater, shockingly does not make you miss meat. It's a faux-meat place (like they still have Sesame Chicken), but they produce it in such a way that it doesn't taste like Morningstar patties nor does it just avoid meat at all; it's totally new and different. Just fantastic. — Trevor Strunk",

It's owned by the same folks behind Zahav. It's essentially a hummus bar -- a hole in the wall with a rotating variety of hummuses every day. You get a big plate of it, along with some Israeli salad, pickles and an incredible fresh-baked pita. It's a lunch spot, where Zahav is a real restaurant.

Only because if I found something good at the O.Co and I'm there for roughly 80 games every season, I'd eat it at every single one of those 80 games. That said, the garlic fries always smell fantastic.
