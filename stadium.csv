Rogers Centre,43.641438,-79.389353,TOR,Toronto Blue Jays,43.6532372,-79.4072797,12,"Pittsburgh is a city made up of many nationalities, the majority of the residents being descendents of countries in Europe. Because of that, the chefs at PNC Park have started to incorporate these flavors into some of the menu items. Sure, you can get nachos or a pretzel, but don’t you want to try something like the pulled pork pierogi stacker, found at Manny’s BBQ behind centerfield? As a bonus, during most games Manny Sanguillen is there signing autographs too.

Pittsburghers love french fries; on their own, on a salad or on a sandwich. If you are in the mood for a Pittsburgh staple, head over to Primanti Brothers behind section 110 to get a sandwich that will have the french fries and coleslaw jammed right into the middle of it.  — Ethan Obstarcyzk

 For my money, the best buy at PNC Park is the house-smoked Pulled Pork Pierogi Stacker. Though Pittsburgh is far too well-known for its Primanti Bros. sandwiches — french fries and thinly sliced deli meat piled high on huge slabs of white bread — what could be more Pittsburgh than house-smoked pulled pork, caramelized onions, and a couple pierogis stacked inside a salty pretzel bun slathered with onion glaze? It’s been a fan favorite for years now. Stop by Manny’s BBQ in center field to give the pulled pork and pierogi stacker a try. The BBQ stand is named after Manny Sanguillen, a former Pirates catcher and three-time All-Star who is a familiar, smiling, everyday staple at Pirates home games. — Stephen Nesbitt

As you get down the 1B/RF concourse at PNC Park (as in, moving from home plate to the right field corner), there's a stretch of local food places that's usually where I find myself eating: Primanti Brothers, Quaker Steak and Lube, and I believe BRGR are all there. It's hard to beat Manny Sanguillen's BBQ out in centerfield behind the bullpens, though, because the pulled pork sandwiches are excellent and Manny himself occasionally hangs out there to sign tickets, bobbleheads, programs, whatever else you might have.  — Pat Lackey

The Federal Street Grille (first level, section 116, behind home plate. There are other locations, but this one I know best) does a killer gigantic footlong hot dog smothered in onions and peppers. Its a really, really legitimate ballpark dog, one of the best I've ever had. That would be my top recommendation. There are some other worthy contenders, including the Pittsburgh Pulled Pork Pierogi Stacker (Pierogis are a Pittsburgh favorite) and the BRGR hamburger and shake (located in the same area as the Federal Street Grill). The former is a very unique, one-of-a-kind food, highly AMERICANtm because it involves stacking unhealthy, doughy, buttery, pierogies on top of pork. The latter is just a damn solid hamburger, well above your average ballpark fair. All told, though, for my money the giant hot dog is king. — Paul Johnson",
